What is data ?
Ans - Raw facts that define the attributes of an entity.

Application
--------------
1.Do specific task have dedicated functinally.
2. Has its own file extension.
3. Platform independent
4. Collection of Packages.

DBMS -->S/W to manage the database
        * delete
        * update
        * insert

TYPES OF DBMS
------------------
1.Network DBMS
2.RDBMS
3.Hierachical DBMS
4.Object oriented DBMS : This is an object based database.

NOTE : Network dbms,hierachical dbms,object oriented dbms, are used before 1970.
       RDBMS after 1971 used.

RELATIONAL DBMS
-------------------
RDBMS : A DBMS which organize and store the data by following Relatinal-Model is known as RDBMS.
        This defines database relational in the from tables, also known as relations.

R-MODEL : DBMS which follows the E.F Codd rules known as R-Model.

TABLE : It is the logical representation of data which consist of rows and columns.
COLUMNS : Attributs and field ,it is used to represent all the properties of all the entities.
ROWS : Records ,truple.
CELL : Smallest unit of table which is used to store a data. 

RULES OF EF CODD RULES :

Rule 1. The data entered into the cell should be single valued or atomic value.

Rule 2. We can store the data in multiple tables if needed we can establish connection b/w two tables using key attributes.

Rule 3: Systematic treatment of NULL
Null has several meanings, it can mean missing data, not applicable or no value. It should be handled consistently. Also, Primary key must not be null, ever. Expression on NULL must give null.
 
Rule 4: Active Online Catalog
Database dictionary(catalog) is the structure description of the complete Database and it must be stored online. The Catalog must be governed by same rules as rest of the database. The same query language should be used on catalog as used to query database.

Rule 5: Powerful and Well-Structured Language
One well structured language must be there to provide all manners of access to the data stored in the database. Example: SQL, etc. If the database allows access to the data without the use of this language, then that is a violation.

Rule 6: View Updation Rule
All the view that are theoretically updatable should be updatable by the system as well.

Rule 7: Relational Level Operation
There must be Insert, Delete, Update operations at each level of relations. Set operation like Union, Intersection and minus should also be supported.

Rule 8: Physical Data Independence
The physical storage of data should not matter to the system. If say, some file supporting table is renamed or moved from one disk to another, it should not effect the application.

Rule 9: Logical Data Independence
If there is change in the logical structure(table structures) of the database the user view of data should not change. Say, if a table is split into two tables, a new view should give result as the join of the two tables. This rule is most difficult to satisfy.

Rule 10: Integrity Independence
The database should be able to enforce its own integrity rather than using other programs. Key and Check constraints, trigger etc, should be stored in Data Dictionary. This also make RDBMS independent of front-end.

Rule 11: Distribution Independence
A database should work properly regardless of its distribution across a network. Even if a database is geographically distributed, with data stored in pieces, the end user should get an impression that it is stored at the same place. This lays the foundation of distributed database.

Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule
If low level access is allowed to a system it should not be able to subvert or bypass integrity rules to change the data. This can be achieved by some sort of looking or encryption.

NOTE : It is not mandatory to have a primary key in the table but it is highly recommented to have a primary key.

Ques) What is constraints ?
Ans - Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.

TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS :
1.NOT NULL : It should have some value or in the other words the constraints is used to specify that the data is mandatory.
2.CHECK CONSTRAINTS : It is an extra validation given to a columns with a conditions.
3.PRIMARY KEY : It is the combination of not null and unique key.
4.UNIQUE KEY : It is used to avoid duplicacy of value into the column.
5.FOREGIN KEY :- It is used to established the relationhip b/w two tables.
               - We can have 'n' number foreign key in table.
               - It can be duplicates and can have null values.

CHARACTERICS  
---------------------
1.A table in which foregin key is present is known as child table.
2.A table in which its actually belong to parents key.
3.FK must and should be define as primary key in parent table.
4.We cannot insert a value in a column define as a FK which is not present in the parent table column.
5.FK is also known as referral integrity constraint.

DATA TYPE 
-----------------
1. Numeric : * Date -> YYYY-MM-DD
             * Time -> HH:MI:SS 
             * DATE TIME -> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS

2. CHAR    : A to Z ,0-9 and some special character.
             char(size)
             char(10)
             Ravi
  *VARCHAR(10)-> Its a variable memory allocation.

NOTE - Data type are mandatory but constraints can be optional.
==========================================================================================================================
SQL 
---------
Language it helps to communicate with RDBMS application.
*IBM was first company to developed which follow the relational model also known as system R.
*IBM developed a language to communicate with system R it is known as SEQUEL(SIMPLE ENGLISH QUERY LANGUAGE).
*ANSI acquried SEQUEL recommended to SQL.
*SQL is standard language for all the RDBMS application.
*SQL is case insensitive language.

ORDBMS=>RDBMS+OODBMS
        An ORDBMS is a hybrid combination of RDBMS and OODBMS(object oriented dbms) that 
        allow developer to integrate the database with their own custom datatype and method.

POSTGRES OR POSTGRESQL 
----------------------------
*Its an open source object relational db.
*It is the worlds most advanced open source relational DB.
*It is written in C language.

DDL :Data defination language

DQL--Data Query Language

There are different ways to retrive the data from table
1.Projection:         
2.Selection:rows and columns
3.Join:retriving a data from multiple table.

Syntax:

SELECT*/[DISTINCT] COLUMN_NAME/EXPRESSION [ALIAS]
FROM TABLE_NAME;

Select*from Employee;---eg selection

*->special character it help us to retrive all the column/data in table.

order of Execution:
from
select
       
select ename from Employee;-- eg projection

write query to display name deptno salary from table.
->select ename.deptno,salary from Employee;

write a query to insert to more then one record in a same table.

Update:
Syntax: update table_name set column_name=value;

Delete:
delete from table_name;

Where Clause: it will execute row by row if the condition got satisfy it will return the value else it will
              reject the row.we use where clause

SELECT*FROM table_name WHERE condition;
syntax: select* from Employee where id=13;

question- W.A.Q to Update a salary whose empid is 104
syntax- update Employee set salary=30000.00 where id=104;

Delete with where clause:
syntax:delete from Employee where empid=12;

Order of Execution:
*from
*where
*select

Qus) insert a two row in a column ?

FUNCTION
----------------------------
Function is a block of code which is use to perform a specific task.

For doing operation on data SQL has many built in functions .

*Aggregate Function -its a multi-row function having N number of input but only give one output. or
                     performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

*Scaler Function - single-row function according to per-input u will get that per-output or  
                   accept one or more parameters but return only one value.

Aggregate Functions are :
1. AVG() - Return avg of all the values of the selected column
2.COUNT() - Return counts of all the values of the selected column
3.MAX() - Return maximum values of all the values of the selected column
4.MIN() - Return minimum  values of all the values of the selected column
5.SUM() - Return sum of all the values of the selected column

AVERAGE :
Syntax - SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

QUES) WAQ to obtained of the avg salary of the emp ?
Ans - select avg(salary) from Employee;

COUNT :
Syntax - SELECT  COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;

QUES) WAQ to obtained of the count salary of the emp ?
Ans - select count(salary) from Employee;

MAX :
Syntax - SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;

QUES) WAQ to obtained of the max salary of the emp ?
Ans - select max(salary) from Employee;
